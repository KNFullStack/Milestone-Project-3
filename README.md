# Introduction

The project is part of a Full Stack Developer course run by CodeInstitute. This is Milestone Project 3. This project was to create a full stack web application with CRUD functionality.

## Milestone Project 3

A mockup of the game can be seen below:

# User Experience Design
## User Stories
### First Time Visitors
* What would I want to see as a first time visitor?
  1. 
  2. 
### Returning Visitors
* What would I want to see as a returning visitor?
  1. 
  2. 
### Frequent Users
* What would I want to see as a frequent visitor?

  2. 

### User Story Screenshots
Below are screenshots relating to some of the user stories.

## Structure
Shown below are elements that correspond to some of the User Stories:
* "thing to correspond to story"
> "story here"

## Design
### Colors
The main colors and design aim... XXX
### Typography
The text throughout the game XXX font.
### Images
"XXX" 
### Sounds
"XXX"
### Wireframes
Wireframes images can be seen below and also found in the "/assets/readme-content" folder. It contains a design for the desktop and mobile version of the game (images below show the game page Wireframes).

* Mobile: <br> ![Mobile Wireframe](XXX)
* Desktop: <br> ![Desktop Wireframe](XXX)

See link for PDF below:
* [Wireframe](XXX)

### Design Deviations
Compared to the original Wireframe there have been multiple deviations.
* "the item changed""
> "changed how and why"

Note: these changes were applied to both the desktop and mobile version of the game.

# Deployment
## Project Creation
To create the project, firstly a Chrome extension called "[Gitpod - Always ready to code](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki?hl=en-GB)" was installed. A CodeInstitute template was use by navigating to the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) and clicking the "Use this template" button. The repository was named "Milestone-Project-3", the checkbox for "Include all branches" was checked and the green "Create repository from template" button was then clicked. From here, the green "GitPod" was then clicked (must use the above extension) and project folders and files created.

Common Git commands were used as follows:
* git add "filename-here" - used to stage files before commiting them.
* git add . - used to stage all files before commiting them.
* git commit -m "message here" - used to commit changes to the local repositry, with the message containing information on the changes that have occured.
* git status - used to check the tracking status of the file in the project.
* git push - used to push the changes to the GitHub repository.

## Publishing
To publish the project I performed the following steps:
1. XXX HOW DID I DEPLOY TO HEROKU?
2. XXX HOW DID I DEPLOY TO HEROKU?
3. XXX HOW DID I DEPLOY TO HEROKU?
4. XXX HOW DID I DEPLOY TO HEROKU?
5. XXX HOW DID I DEPLOY TO HEROKU?

## Local Clone
To create a local clone of the project you can follow the steps below:
1. Navigate to the project's [Github page](https://github.com/KNFullStack/Milestone-Project-3).
2. Click the "Code" dropdown button.
3. From here there are two options:
     * Option 1: Click the "Download ZIP" button to download the files. This can be unzipped locally and opened with your preferred IDE.
     * Option 2: Copy the link from the HTTPS box shown. Then open your preferred IDE of choice and in the terminal window of your preferred directory, use the command "git clone" followed by the link that was copied. For example "git clone https://github.com/KNFullStack/Milestone-Project-3.git". This will clone the files in the selected directory.
